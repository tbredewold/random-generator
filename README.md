# random-generator
*This is a random generator project

The idea is to make a random generator that is powerful enough to render as many pixels, as often as possible in a random color.

This has to do with the theory that because someone is watching it, something will come out.

Untill now I managed to make something very simple using plain javascript. The performance however is very poor. Please feel free to collaborate on this project to improve the performance or use different techniques to get the job done.

Greetings, Thomas
